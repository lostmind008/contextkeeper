# Multi-Project RAG Agent v2.0 - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

Successfully transformed the RAG Knowledge Agent from a single-project tool into a comprehensive multi-project development context awareness system. The enhancement maintains full backward compatibility while adding powerful project management capabilities.

## 📋 Completed Features

### 1. **Multi-Project Support** ✅
- Dynamic project creation and management
- Independent ChromaDB collections per project
- Project-aware file watching and ingestion
- Automatic legacy project import

### 2. **Project Lifecycle Management** ✅
- Create, pause, resume, and archive projects
- Project focus switching
- State persistence across sessions
- Configuration stored in `~/.rag_projects/`

### 3. **Decision & Objective Tracking** ✅
- Record architectural decisions with reasoning
- Tag decisions for categorization
- Set project objectives with priorities
- Track objective completion status
- Full integration with vector search

### 4. **Context Export for AI Agents** ✅
- Export rich project context via API
- Include recent decisions and pending objectives
- Statistics and activity summaries
- Ready for MCP server integration

### 5. **Enhanced CLI Interface** ✅
- Comprehensive project management commands
- Intuitive shortcuts (p, d, o, c, b)
- Colorful output with icons
- Daily briefing functionality
- Backward compatible with v1.0

### 6. **REST API Extensions** ✅
- `/projects` endpoints for management
- `/objectives` endpoints for tracking
- `/context` endpoint for AI export
- Project-aware query filtering

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### Core Components
1. **project_manager.py** - New module for project lifecycle
2. **Enhanced rag_agent.py** - Multi-project aware operations
3. **rag_cli_v2.sh** - Feature-rich CLI interface
4. **Per-project collections** - Isolated vector storage

### Key Design Decisions
- Separate collections per project for true isolation
- JSON-based project configuration for simplicity
- Backward compatibility through legacy import
- Focus-based default project selection
