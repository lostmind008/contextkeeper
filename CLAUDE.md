## üõ†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS

### Code Style (Follow User's Preferences)
```python
# Use Australian English spelling
colour = "blue"  # not color
behaviour = "expected"  # not behavior

# Conversational comments (user's signature style)
# alright, so the idea here is to...
# basically, we need to do this because...
# fair warning - this might seem unconventional, but...
```

### Architecture Patterns to Follow
- **Sacred Layer**: Immutable storage, 2-layer verification, isolated ChromaDB
- **Project Isolation**: Each project gets own ChromaDB collection
- **Git Integration**: Track commits, not file changes
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Sacred plans act as guardrails for AI agents

### Testing Approach
```bash
# Always test after changes
pytest tests/sacred -v          # Sacred layer
pytest tests/git -v             # Git integration  
pytest tests/drift -v           # Drift detection
python test_multiproject.py     # End-to-end
```

## üìÅ FILE NAVIGATION MAP

**Core Sacred Files** (what you'll work with most):
```
rag_agent.py                 # Main orchestrator - ADD sacred integration here
sacred_layer_implementation.py  # Sacred core - USE as-is
git_activity_tracker.py     # Git tracking - USE as-is
enhanced_drift_sacred.py    # Drift detection - USE as-is
sacred_cli_integration.sh   # CLI commands - SOURCE this
```

**Reference Implementations** (approved patterns):
```
v3 Approved Plan for AI Agent/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sacred_layer_implementation.py    # Reference if needed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ enhanced_mcp_server.js           # MCP server for later
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analytics_dashboard.html         # Dashboard for later
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ revised_implementation_roadmap.md # Complete vision
```

## ‚ö° COMMON WORKFLOWS

### Sacred Plan Workflow (v3.0 target)
```bash
# 1. Create plan
./rag_cli.sh sacred create proj_123 "Auth Architecture" auth_plan.md

# 2. Approve with 2-layer verification  
./rag_cli.sh sacred approve plan_abc123

# 3. Check alignment
./rag_cli.sh sacred drift proj_123
```

### LLM-Enhanced Query Testing (Phase 2.5)
```bash
# Test natural language responses
curl -X POST http://localhost:5555/query_llm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is the sacred layer?", "k": 5}'

# Compare with raw query  
curl -X POST http://localhost:5555/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is the sacred layer?", "k": 5}'
```

## üö® CURRENT BLOCKERS & GOTCHAS

1. **Sacred Integration**: Need to import sacred components into `rag_agent.py`
2. **Environment Key**: Set `SACRED_APPROVAL_KEY` in `.env` before testing
3. **ChromaDB Isolation**: Sacred plans MUST use separate collections
4. **Backward Compatibility**: v2.0 functionality must keep working

## üß≠ CONTEXT HIERARCHY

When you need more info, check in this order:
1. `AI_AGENT_TODO_EXPANDED.md` - Micro-tasks (current work)
2. `v3 Approved Plan for AI Agent/AI Agent TODO List.md` - Step-by-step guide
3. `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - All CLI commands
4. `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - v2.0 implementation summary

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA - ACHIEVED ‚úÖ

**Phase 1-3 COMPLETE:**
- [x] Sacred layer activated and operational on port 5556
- [x] `rag_agent.py` imports and integrates sacred components
- [x] Sacred plan creation works with 2-layer verification
- [x] 2-layer approval process operational
- [x] Drift detection compares against sacred plans
- [x] All sacred endpoints responding correctly
- [x] MCP Server Integration complete with 8 tools
- [x] Claude Code can access all sacred functionality via MCP tools

**PRODUCTION READY:** ContextKeeper v3.0 Sacred Layer is fully operational

## ‚öôÔ∏è ENVIRONMENT CHECK

Required for sacred layer:
```bash
# Check these exist
echo $SACRED_APPROVAL_KEY        # Should be set
ls sacred_layer_implementation.py # Should exist
ls tests/sacred/                 # Should exist
./upgrade_to_v3_sacred.sh --check # Should pass
```

## üìù DOCUMENTATION MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL

### Critical Learning: Avoid Misleading Legacy Documentation
**Issue Discovered**: Comments and documentation left behind during development can mislead future readers who might assume outdated status represents current state rather than checking latest enhancements.

**Mandatory Practice for AI Coding Agents:**
1. **Clean Up As You Go**: Remove outdated comments, TODOs, and status indicators immediately when completing work
2. **Update Status Consistently**: Ensure all documentation files reflect current implementation state
3. **Remove Placeholder Content**: Delete template comments, example code, and "TODO" markers when functionality is complete
4. **Verify Cross-References**: Check that all file references, command examples, and technical details match actual implementation
5. **Document Completion**: Mark phases/tasks as complete in ALL relevant files, not just primary documentation

**Example**: After completing Phase 3, ALL files should show "Phase 3 COMPLETE" status, not mixed states like "Phase 1 Ready" in some files and "Phase 3 Complete" in others.

**Why This Matters**: Future developers (including AI agents) rely on documentation accuracy. Inconsistent or outdated documentation creates confusion and can lead to incorrect assumptions about project state.
