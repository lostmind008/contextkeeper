# ContextKeeper Branch Strategy & Recovery Points

**Created**: 2025-07-24  
**Purpose**: Document branch strategy for safe Sacred Layer implementation exploration

## üå≥ Branch Structure

### `master` - Production Stable
- **Status**: Original stable version (v2.0 baseline)
- **Use**: Final production-ready releases only
- **Protection**: Never force push, always merge via PR

### `ContextKeeper-v3.0-upgrade` - Documentation & Fixes Complete ‚úÖ
- **Status**: **STABLE RECOVERY POINT** 
- **Commit**: `e1b2bf3` - All documentation cleanup and node_modules fixes complete
- **Contains**:
  - ‚úÖ Complete documentation accuracy alignment
  - ‚úÖ Node_modules ingestion issue resolved
  - ‚úÖ YouTube contamination removed
  - ‚úÖ Port references corrected
  - ‚úÖ Markdown linting standards met
  - ‚úÖ Critical implementation gap documented
  - ‚úÖ Documentation maintenance protocol established

### `ContextKeeper-v3.1-sacred-layer-implementation` - Current Working Branch üöß
- **Status**: **ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**
- **Branched From**: `ContextKeeper-v3.0-upgrade` at commit `e1b2bf3`
- **Purpose**: Sacred Layer implementation experiments
- **Risk Level**: HIGH (implementation changes to core functionality)
- **Recovery**: Can always return to `ContextKeeper-v3.0-upgrade` if needed

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Strategy

### Recovery Options Available

**Option 1: Continue Current Path**
```bash
# Stay on current branch and implement Sacred Layer
git checkout ContextKeeper-v3.1-sacred-layer-implementation
# Continue development here
```

**Option 2: Return to Stable Point**
```bash
# Switch back to stable documentation-complete branch
git checkout ContextKeeper-v3.0-upgrade
# Create new branch for different approach
git checkout -b ContextKeeper-v3.1-alternative-approach
```

**Option 3: Emergency Recovery**
```bash
# If implementation branch becomes problematic
git checkout ContextKeeper-v3.0-upgrade
# Stable state with all documentation fixes intact
```

## üìä Implementation Approach Options

### Current Position: `ContextKeeper-v3.1-sacred-layer-implementation`
From this branch, we can safely explore:

**Approach A: Sacred Layer MVP** (Recommended)
- Implement core sacred plan storage
- Add basic drift detection
- Skip complex verification initially  
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks

**Approach B: Enhanced Working System**
- Perfect v2.0 RAG system
- Add valuable features to existing functionality
- Focus on reliability over innovation
- Timeline: 1 week

**Approach C: Full Sacred Layer Implementation**
- Complete all 83 TODOs
- Implement full 2-layer verification
- High risk, high reward
- Timeline: 4-8 weeks

## ‚úÖ Commit Reference Points

### Stable Recovery Point: `e1b2bf3`
- **Branch**: `ContextKeeper-v3.0-upgrade` 
- **State**: All documentation accurate, all fixes applied
- **What Works**: v2.0 RAG system + node_modules fix + clean documentation
- **Guarantee**: Can always return here for working system

### Previous Commits Available:
- `367f38e` - Critical findings documented
- `434f9cc` - Documentation maintenance protocol added
- `e0497bd` - Complete documentation cleanup
- `eb1b1d5` - Node_modules ingestion fix

## üéØ Decision Framework

**When to Continue Current Branch:**
- Sacred Layer implementation progressing well
- Tests passing as functionality is added
- User satisfied with development direction

**When to Return to Stable Branch:**
- Implementation becomes too complex
- Breaking changes affect core functionality  
- Need to explore different approach
- Timeline concerns arise

**When to Create Additional Branches:**
- Want to explore multiple approaches simultaneously
- Need to preserve experimental work while trying alternatives
- Collaborative development with multiple strategies

## üìã Branch Management Best Practices

### Before Making Risky Changes:
1. Ensure current branch is committed and pushed to GitHub
2. Document what you're about to attempt
3. Set success/failure criteria upfront
4. Plan recovery steps if attempt fails

### While Developing:
1. Commit frequently with descriptive messages
2. Push to GitHub regularly
3. Update this document with progress/decisions
4. Test incrementally, don't build everything at once

### Recovery Process:
1. Assess current state honestly
2. Document lessons learned
3. Switch to appropriate recovery branch  
4. Create new branch for next attempt if needed

---

**Current Status**: Positioned at optimal decision point with multiple safe recovery options available.

**Next Action**: Choose implementation approach and begin development on `ContextKeeper-v3.1-sacred-layer-implementation` branch with confidence that stable recovery point exists at `ContextKeeper-v3.0-upgrade`.
