```

## üîß Step-by-Step Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Extend Your Current RAG Agent

Add these new files to your `/Users/sumitm1/rag-agent` directory:

```bash
cd /Users/sumitm1/rag-agent

# Create enhanced agent file
# (Use the "Enhanced Multi-Project RAG Agent" artifact above)
```

**Key new capabilities:**
- **Multi-project session management** - Track multiple projects simultaneously
- **Terminal activity monitoring** - Correlate commands with projects
- **Project lifecycle management** - Pause/resume/archive projects
- **Objective tracking** - Set and monitor development goals
- **Drift detection** - Identify when you're getting off-track

#### 1.2 Database Schema for Terminal Monitoring

```sql
-- SQLite schema for terminal activity
CREATE TABLE terminal_activity (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    pid INTEGER,
    working_dir TEXT,
    command TEXT,
    timestamp TEXT,
    project_id TEXT,
    is_focused BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

CREATE TABLE projects (
    project_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    root_path TEXT,
    status TEXT, -- active, paused, archived, focused
    watch_dirs TEXT, -- JSON array
    focused_terminals TEXT, -- JSON array of PIDs
    created_at TEXT,
    last_active TEXT,
    objectives TEXT, -- JSON array
    decisions TEXT -- JSON array
);
```

### Phase 2: Terminal Monitoring (Week 1-2)

#### 2.1 Advanced Terminal Monitoring

The enhanced agent uses multiple approaches to monitor terminal activity:

1. **Process monitoring** via `psutil` - tracks active terminal sessions
2. **Command history parsing** - reads from shell history files
3. **Working directory correlation** - maps activity to projects
4. **Focus management** - allows you to specify which terminals to prioritize

#### 2.2 Real-time Activity Correlation

```python
# Example of how terminal activity gets correlated
def correlate_activity_to_project(self, activity):
    """Maps terminal activity to specific projects"""
    working_dir = activity.working_dir
    
    # Check if working directory is within any project's watch directories
    for project_id, project in self.project_manager.projects.items():
        for watch_dir in project.watch_dirs:
            if working_dir.startswith(watch_dir):
                return project_id
    return None
```

### Phase 3: MCP Integration (Week 2)

#### 3.1 Set Up MCP Server

Create the MCP server to bridge your RAG agent with Claude Code and other AI tools:

```bash
cd /Users/sumitm1/rag-agent
mkdir mcp-server
cd mcp-server

# Create package.json
cat > package.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "rag-knowledge-agent-mcp",
  "version": "1.0.0", 
  "description": "MCP Server for Enhanced RAG Knowledge Agent",
  "type": "module",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "dev": "node --watch server.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk": "^0.4.0",
    "node-fetch": "^3.3.2"
  }
}
EOF

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy the MCP server code (from artifact above)
# Save as server.js
```

#### 3.2 Configure Claude Code Integration

Add to your Claude Code configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rag-knowledge-agent": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/sumitm1/rag-agent/mcp-server/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "RAG_AGENT_URL": "http://localhost:5555"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Phase 4: Enhanced CLI Interface (Week 2-3)

#### 4.1 Replace Your Current CLI

The enhanced CLI (from the artifact above) provides:

```bash
# Multi-project management
rag projects create "YouTube Analyzer" ~/Documents/myproject/youtube-analyzer
rag projects pause proj_1234567890
rag projects resume proj_1234567890

# Focus management  
rag focus set proj_1234567890
rag focus terminals proj_1234567890  # Select which terminals to monitor

# Objective tracking
rag objectives add proj_1234567890 "Implement user authentication"
rag objectives complete proj_1234567890 0

# Context for AI agents
rag context claude proj_1234567890  # Export context for Claude Code
rag briefing  # Get comprehensive daily briefing

# Drift detection
rag drift check proj_1234567890  # See if you're staying on track
```

## üîÑ Daily Workflow Examples

### Morning Routine
```bash
# Get daily briefing
rag briefing

# Focus on today's main project
rag focus set proj_youtube_analyzer

# Set today's objectives
rag objectives add proj_youtube_analyzer "Fix authentication bug"
rag objectives add proj_youtube_analyzer "Add video upload validation"

# Focus on specific terminals (get PIDs with: ps aux | grep -E "(bash|zsh)")
rag focus terminals proj_youtube_analyzer 12345 67890
```

### During Development
```bash
# Check what you've been working on
rag terminals activity

# Get context for Claude Code
rag context claude  # Auto-uses focused project

# Record important decisions
rag add "Using JWT tokens for session management" "Better security than session cookies"

# Check if you're staying on track
rag drift check
```

### End of Day
```bash
# Review progress
rag briefing

# Mark completed objectives
rag objectives complete proj_youtube_analyzer 0

# Pause non-critical projects
rag projects pause proj_old_website
```

## ü§ñ AI Agent Integration Benefits

### For Claude Code
With the MCP server, Claude Code will have access to:

1. **Real-time project context** - knows what you're currently working on
2. **Recent terminal activity** - understands your latest commands and actions
3. **Project objectives** - can help you stay focused on goals
4. **Decision history** - remembers architectural choices you've made
5. **Drift detection** - can warn if you're getting off-track

### Example Claude Code Interaction
```
You: "Help me implement user authentication"

Claude Code: 
> Using get_project_context tool...
> 
> I can see you're working on the YouTube Analyzer project and have
> "Implement user authentication" as an active objective. 
> 
> Based on your recent terminal activity, I notice you've been working
> in the backend/auth directory and have already set up JWT tokens
> (from your decision log).
> 
> Let me help you continue from where you left off...
```

## üìä Drift Detection & Objective Alignment

### How It Works
The system analyzes:
1. **Your stated objectives** - what you said you'd work on
2. **Recent terminal commands** - what you actually worked on  
3. **File changes** - which files you modified
4. **Time spent** - where you spent your development time

### Example Drift Detection
```bash
rag drift check

# Output:
‚ö†Ô∏è Potential objective drift detected (alignment: 45%)

Current Objectives:
1. Implement user authentication
2. Add video upload validation

Recent Activity Focus:
- CSS styling changes
- Frontend component refactoring  
- Database schema updates (unrelated)

Recommendation: Consider if recent work aligns with current objectives.
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Terminal Monitoring Approaches

1. **Process Monitoring** (Primary)
   - Uses `psutil` to track active terminal processes
   - Monitors working directories of terminal sessions
   - Tracks process creation/termination

2. **Shell History Parsing** (Secondary)
   - Reads from `~/.zsh_history`, `~/.bash_history`
   - Correlates recent commands with projects
   - Handles different shell history formats

3. **Focus Management** (Manual)
   - You explicitly tell the system which terminals to prioritize
   - Useful when working on multiple projects simultaneously
   - Helps filter noise from background terminal sessions

### Project Correlation Logic

```python
def correlate_activity_to_project(activity):
    working_dir = activity.working_dir
    
    # Priority 1: Focused terminals
    for project in focused_projects:
        if activity.pid in project.focused_terminals:
            return project.project_id
    
    # Priority 2: Path matching
    for project in active_projects:
        for watch_dir in project.watch_dirs:
            if working_dir.startswith(watch_dir):
                return project.project_id
    
    # Priority 3: Recent project activity
    return get_most_recently_active_project()
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Backup your current setup**:
   ```bash
   cp -r /Users/sumitm1/rag-agent /Users/sumitm1/rag-agent-backup
   ```

2. **Create your first multi-project setup**:
   ```bash
   # Add your YouTube Analyzer as a proper project
   rag projects create "YouTube Analyzer" "/Users/sumitm1/Documents/myproject/Ongoing Projects/LostMindAI - Youtube Analyser Tool"
   
   # Set it as focused
   rag focus set proj_<generated_id>
   
   # Add current objectives
   rag objectives add proj_<generated_id> "Complete Gemini integration"
   rag objectives add proj_<generated_id> "Implement agent coordination"
   ```

3. **Test terminal monitoring**:
   ```bash
   # Start monitoring
   rag terminals monitor
   
   # In another terminal, run some commands in your project directory
   cd ~/Documents/myproject/...
   ls
   git status
   
   # Check if it's being tracked
   rag terminals activity
   ```

4. **Set up MCP integration** for Claude Code access

## üí° Advanced Features You Can Add Later

### Phase 5: Advanced Analytics
- **Time tracking** - how long you spend in each project area
- **Productivity metrics** - commands per hour, file changes, etc.
- **Pattern recognition** - identify your most productive work patterns
- **Integration with git** - track commits and correlate with objectives

### Phase 6: Team Collaboration
- **Shared project contexts** - team members can see project status
- **Decision synchronization** - share architectural decisions across team
- **Objective coordination** - align individual work with team goals

### Phase 7: Smart Suggestions
- **Objective suggestions** - AI suggests next logical objectives
- **Drift prevention** - proactive warnings before you get off-track
- **Context switching optimization** - minimize context loss when switching projects

## üéØ Expected Benefits

### For You
- **Never lose context** when switching between projects
- **Stay focused** on current objectives with drift detection
- **Better decision tracking** - remember why you made certain choices
- **Improved productivity** - less time spent remembering what you were working on

### For AI Assistants (Claude Code, etc.)
- **Rich context** about your current work and objectives
- **Historical context** about past decisions and approaches  
- **Real-time awareness** of your current focus and recent activity
- **Better suggestions** based on your actual working patterns

This enhanced RAG agent would be a game-changer for development productivity and AI-assisted coding! The combination of multi-project tracking, terminal monitoring, and AI integration creates a comprehensive development context awareness system.
