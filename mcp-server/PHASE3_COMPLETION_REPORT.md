## ðŸ”§ MCP Tools Successfully Implemented

1. **get_sacred_context** - Provides sacred plans to Claude Code
2. **check_sacred_drift** - Real-time violation detection
3. **query_with_llm** - Natural language responses via Phase 2.5
4. **export_development_context** - Complete project context with sacred awareness
5. **get_development_context** - Comprehensive project status
6. **intelligent_search** - Semantic search across sacred plans
7. **create_sacred_plan** - Sacred plan creation with approval workflow
8. **health_check** - System monitoring and status verification

## ðŸ“‹ Claude Code Integration Ready

### Configuration File Created
- **Location**: `claude-code-config.json`
- **Purpose**: Ready-to-use configuration for Claude Code MCP integration
- **Command**: Full path to enhanced MCP server specified

### Integration Command
```bash
# Add to Claude Code (copy path from config file):
claude mcp add contextkeeper-sacred "node /Users/sumitm1/Documents/myproject/Ongoing Projects/ContextKeeper Pro/ContextKeeper v3 Upgrade/contextkeeper/mcp-server/enhanced_mcp_server.js"
```

## ðŸš€ Phase 3 Technical Achievements

### Testing Results
- **JSON-RPC Protocol**: Working correctly
- **Tool Discovery**: All 8 tools discoverable via `tools/list`
- **Tool Execution**: Health check and other tools responding properly
- **Sacred Context**: Health checks confirm Sacred Layer is active
- **Real-time Status**: All system components verified as operational

## ðŸŽ‰ Phase 3 COMPLETE - Ready for Claude Code

**Summary**: Phase 3 MCP Server Integration has been successfully completed. The enhanced MCP server is operational with all 8 sacred-aware tools, connected to the Sacred Layer, and ready for Claude Code integration. All success criteria have been met and verified through comprehensive testing.

**Next Steps**: The system is now ready for developers to integrate with Claude Code using the provided configuration. The MCP server will enable Claude Code to access sacred architectural plans and ensure AI-aware development that respects approved constraints.

**Sacred Layer Status**: âœ… ACTIVE and preventing AI agent violations  
**MCP Server Status**: âœ… RUNNING with 8 tools available  
**Claude Code Integration**: âœ… READY with configuration provided
