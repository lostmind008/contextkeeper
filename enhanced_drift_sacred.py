enhanced_drift_sacred.py - Sacred-aware drift detection for ContextKeeper v3.0

Created: 2025-07-24 03:43:00 (Australia/Sydney)
Part of: ContextKeeper v3.0 Sacred Layer Upgrade

Purpose:
Enhances drift detection to compare current development against sacred plans,
providing real-time alerts when code deviates from approved architectural plans.

Key Features:
- Compare code changes against sacred plans
- Calculate alignment scores
- Detect violations in real-time
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Support continuous monitoring

Dependencies:
- scikit-learn for similarity calculations
- Integration with Sacred Layer
- Git activity tracking
