# Sacred Plan: ContextKeeper v3.0 Architecture

## Purpose
This plan governs the architectural decisions for ContextKeeper v3.0 Sacred Layer implementation.

## Core Principles
1. **Immutability**: Once approved, sacred plans cannot be modified
2. **Two-Layer Verification**: Both verification code and approval key required
3. **Backward Compatibility**: v2.0 functionality must remain intact

## Technical Decisions
- **Technology Choice**: Python with ChromaDB for vector storage
- **Architecture Pattern**: Modular components with clean separation
- **Key Constraints**: Sacred plans stored separately from regular knowledge

## Implementation Guidelines
- All sacred plans must be stored in isolated ChromaDB collections
- Git activity tracking must be non-blocking
- Drift detection should run asynchronously
- API endpoints must handle sacred layer failures gracefully

## Success Criteria
- Sacred plans remain immutable after approval
- 2-layer verification prevents unauthorized changes
- Drift detection identifies deviations within 5 minutes
- v2.0 functionality continues working if v3.0 components fail
